          Thoughtworks uses Cloud Carbon Footprint to set a baseline for your emissions and identify areas to focus on that will provide the highest return on investment. Leveraging years of cloud optimization experience, weâ€™ll provide recommendations for ways to reconfigure, optimize or re-architect your use of the cloud as well as audit your SaaS (and platform/infrastructure as a service) use to suggest greener alternatives or more efficient ways to optimize your cloud usage.
